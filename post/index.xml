      <description>There was a SemEval 2018 Shared Task on “irony detection in tweets” that ended recently. As a fun personal project, I thought of giving it a shot, just to implement some new ideas. In this post, I will describe my approach for the problem along with some code.
Problem description The task itself was divided into two subtasks:
 Task A: Binary classification. Given a tweet, detect whether it has irony or not.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Learning Theory - Part 2</title>

      <description>In the first part of this series on learning theory, we looked only at the case of finite hypothesis sets, and derived some generalization bounds using the PAC learning framework. However, in most practical cases, the hypothesis class is usually infinite. To measure the complexity of the class in such cases, 3 different measures are often used — Rademacher complexity, growth function, and VC dimension. In this article, I will discuss all of these.</description>

      <description>One of the most significant take-aways from NIPS 2017 was the &amp;ldquo;alchemy&amp;rdquo; debate spearheaded by Ali Rahimi. In the wake of the event, I have been trying to learn more about statistical learning theory, even though the concepts may not be readily applicable to deep neural networks.
One of the most important concepts in this regard is to measure the complexity of a hypothesis class $H$. In any machine learning model, the end goal is to find a hypothesis class that achieves a high accuracy on the training set, and has low generalization error on the test set.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Approaches for NMT</title>

      <description>Translation is one of those tasks in language where the arrival of deep learning systems, and in particular sequence-to-sequence, has been something like a boon. In less than 4 years since the first paper on Neural Machine Translation, software giants such as Google and Microsoft have already announced that their translation systems have almost completely shifted from statistical to neural. Gone are the days when researchers mulled over complex word and phrase alignment techniques, and yet fell short on several language combinations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Euclidean Embeddings</title>

      <description>Representation learning, as the name suggests, seeks to learn representations for structures such as images, videos, words, sentencences, graphs, etc., which may then be used for several objectives. Arguably the most important representations used nowadays are word embeddings, usually learnt using the distributional semantics methods such as skip-gram or GloVe. I have previously written about these methods here.
Two assumptions are inherent while using these methods to learn word vectors:</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Multimodal Systems</title>

      <description>When I was browsing through research groups for my grad school applications, I came across some interesting applications of new deep learning methods in a multimodal setting. ‘Multimodal,’ as the name suggests, refers to any system involving two or more modes of input or output. For example, an image captioning system provides images as input and expects a textual output. Similarly, speech-to-text, descriptive art, video summarization, etc., are all examples of multimodal objectives.</description>

      <description>In Part 1 of this two-part series, I discussed some supervised approaches for the objective. In this part, we will look at some unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches, namely a Bayesian model, and transfer learning.
An unsupervised Bayesian model This paper was published in ACL 20111, back when statistical methods were still being used for NLP tasks. But with the recent forays into generative models, I feel it has again become relevant to understand how such methods worked.</description>

      <title>The Best Papers at ICLR 2017</title>

      <description>The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) has evolved into the deep learning conference over the last few years, and with its open review system, it is not difficult to understand why. I was recently going through some of the papers accepted at this year’s ICLR, especially the 3 that were awarded the Best Paper award. In this article, I will try to summarize these 3 papers in simple words, and hopefully get an idea about what’s hot in deep learning.</description>

      <title>The Last 3 Years in Text Classification</title>

      <description>While working on my undergrad thesis on relation classification of biomedical text using deep learning methods, I quickly hacked together models in Tensorflow that combined convolutional and recurrent layers in various combinations. While some of these “network architectures” worked superbly (even surpassing state-of-the-art results), I had no clue what was happening inside the model. To gain such an intuition, I read about 20 recent papers on text classification (starting with the first “CNN for sentence classification” paper by Yoon Kim) over the course of a week.</description>

      <description>This article is a formal representation of my understanding of vector semantics, from course notes and reading reference papers and chapters from Jurafsky’s SLP book. I will be talking about sparse and dense vector semantics, including SVD, skip-gram, and GloVe. In many places, I will try to explain the ideas in language rather than equations (but I’ll provide links to derivations and stuff wherever it is absolutely essential, which is actually everywhere!</description>

      <title>Trends in Semantic Parsing - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://desh2608.github.io/post/trends-in-semantic-parsing-1/</link>

      <description>In this article, I will try to round up some (mostly neural) approaches for semantic parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL). This is not an extensive review of these methods, but just a collection of my notes on reading some recent research on the subject. However, I do believe it covers most of the latest trends as well as their limitations.
But first, what is semantic parsing?
“Semantic” refers to meaning, and “parsing” means resolving a sentence into its component parts.</description>

      <title>Metrics for NLG Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://desh2608.github.io/post/metrics-for-nlg-evaluation/</link>

      <guid>https://desh2608.github.io/post/metrics-for-nlg-evaluation/</guid>
      <description>Simple natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, or even more complex ones like semantic parsing are easy to evaluate since the evaluation simply requires label matching. As such, metrics like F-score (which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall), or even accuracy in uniformly distributed data, are used for such tasks.
Evaluating natural language generation systems is a much more complex task, however. And for this reason, a number of different metrics have been proposed for tasks such as machine translation or summarization.</description>
