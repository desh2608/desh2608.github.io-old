      <description>This project was first floated as a Kaggle competition, with the dataset made available by Bosch.
In this work, we pose the task of fault detection as a binary classification problem. The features include numerical, categorical, and timestamp features, and hence warranty a combination of several techniques for efficiently solving the problem.
First, a biased sampling method is used to reduce the effect of skewed data distribution. Thereafter, the categorical features are represented as 3 numerical features using sparse online classification algorithms: stochastic truncated gradient (STG), forward-backward splitting (FOBOS), and enhanced regularized dual averaging (ERDA).</description>

      <title>Fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) clustering</title>

      <description> Worked on improving clustering performance of fuzzy ART algorithm by integrating Interval Type-2 approach into vigilance parameter computation. Obtained 5-10% better classification results compared to earlier ART methods, on several benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, and real world image segmentation tasks.  </description>
