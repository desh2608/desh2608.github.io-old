      <description>In this article, I will try to round up some (mostly neural) approaches for semantic parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL). This is not an extensive review of these methods, but just a collection of my notes on reading some recent research on the subject. However, I do believe it covers most of the latest trends as well as their limitations.
But first, what is semantic parsing?
“Semantic” refers to meaning, and “parsing” means resolving a sentence into its component parts.</description>
