      <description>Sparse vectors have become popular recently for 2 reasons:
 Sparse matrices require much less storage since they can be stored using various space-saving methods. Sparse vectors are much more interpretable than dense vectors. For instance, the non-zero non-negative components of a sparse word vector may be taken to denote the weights for certain features. In contrast, there is no interpretation for a value like $-0.1347$.  Sparsity is often induced through the use of L1 (or Lasso) regularization.</description>
