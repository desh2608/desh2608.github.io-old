      <description>This article is a formal representation of my understanding of vector semantics, from course notes and reading reference papers and chapters from Jurafsky’s SLP book. I will be talking about sparse and dense vector semantics, including SVD, skip-gram, and GloVe. In many places, I will try to explain the ideas in language rather than equations (but I’ll provide links to derivations and stuff wherever it is absolutely essential, which is actually everywhere!</description>
